# FlexiHUD for GZDoom

**FlexiHUD** is a universal, highly flexible HUD mod for GZDoom, written entirely in ZScript. Not only can you see all the usual information and a lot more, but you can also MOVE every single element!

## Features
* FlexiHUD replaces default HUD, not the AltHud. Make sure AltHud is off. FlexiHUD doesn't differentiate between fullscreen and statusbar modes.
* Not a single graphical element — everything is done through code.
* Every single element can be toggled on/off, attached to any screen angle or edge, and offset from there.
* Many elements have several display modes (such as disabled/autohide after delay/always show)
* You can select your own color and opacity for background of the elements
* Heretic, Hexen and Strife support: full inventory bar with fluid animation. Hexen armor is fully accounted for and displays all possessed armor elements.
* Can display powerup icons even for powerups that don't have them (like Doom powerups).
* Currently supports 6 languages: English, German, French, Brazilian Portugeze, Spanish LatAm and Russian. All text is in LANGUAGE.csv, more localizations are welcome.
* Heavily commented code—I hope you can learn from it!
* MIT licence (can be used by anyone for any purpose)
